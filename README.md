# saturn-demo

## The Saturn application
You can start this application through a call to `dotnet run`. It hosts a few endpoints (`get`, `getF` and `post`) and illustrates raw text and JSON handling.

## Consuming endpoints
The `sample.fsx` contains some sample code to consume the endpoints using an F# script, through an older version of the HTTP.fs library.
